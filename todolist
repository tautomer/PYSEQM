TODO list:
1) move current seqm functions (overlap/Fock matrix generation, force, etc.) into molecule modules (pynexmd/mole/molecule.py)
2) move mathematical operations (matrix-vector, matrix-matrix, and tensor production) into lib/mathlib (Yu and ?)
3) TDHF module: energies and forces (Yu and Xinyang). 
   3b)In long term: spin-flip and spin-complete versions of CIS are to be implemented
4) New MD module: move MD integration into MD modules (?)
5) NAMD module and AIMC: (Victor and Yu?)
6) mathlib: write an optimized einsum based on numpy.einsum and torch.einsum (Yu and ?)
6) logger system (?)


How to contribute:
 1) fork the branch
 2) make changes in the forked branch
 3) after new functions are tested, send pull request (PR) 
    !!!DON'T directly push changes into upsream. New implementation should only be merged after a review.
