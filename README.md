# [PYNEXMD: PYthon-based non-adiabatic molecular dynamics package](https://github.com/lanl/PYNEXMD)

[PYNEXMD](https://github.com/lanl/PYNEXMD) is a PYthon-based Nonadiabatic EXcited-State Molecular Dynamics package that leverages the [PyTorch](http://pytorch.org) and BML library for off-loading caculations on GPUs and/or heterogeneous exascale computing facilities. It provides build-in Semi-Empirical Quantum Mechanics method for electronic structures and interface to other first-principles packages (DFTB, PYSCF). It provides built-in interfaces for machine learning and efficient molecular dynamic engines with GPU supported. Several molecular Adiabatic and Non-adiabatic dynamics algorithms are implemented for facilitating dynamic simulations, inlcuding orginal and Extended Lagrangian Born-Oppenheimer Molecular Dynamics, geometric optimization, trajectory surface hopping, ab-initio multiple cloning, Ehrenfest dynamics.

* Off-load on heterogeneous exascale computing architecture via BML lib
* Efficient expansion algorithm [SP2](https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.66.155115) for generating density matrix
* Stable and Efficient Extended Lagrangian Born Oppenheimer Molecular Dynamics ([XL-BOMD](https://aip.scitation.org/doi/full/10.1063/1.3148075))
* Trajectory surface hopping 
* Ab-initio multiple cloning
* Light-matter interaction
* Time-dependent density functional tight-binding
